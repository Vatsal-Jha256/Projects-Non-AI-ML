This repository contains small coding projects I have worked on to strengthen my programming skills and understanding of data structures and algorithms.

Current projects include:

    Autocomplete system using a Trie data structure for efficient prefix lookup
    Larson scanner implementation for generating random permutations
    Registration form with client-side validation using HTML/CSS/JS

Through these bite-sized projects, I'm hoping to expand my toolkit across languages and problem spaces. Over time, I plan to implement fundamental CS concepts like:

    Classic algorithms (sorting, searching, graph traversal)
    More data structures (trees, graphs, hashes)
    Front-end programming
    Basic database interactions

This repository charts my progress in becoming a well-rounded programmer. I welcome any feedback, critiques, or suggestions for additional projects that would be worthwhile to implement.
